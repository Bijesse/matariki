##Scope
In this project students will learn about the origins of Matariki and will then create a program that will educated friends and family about Matariki through playing with their program.

##Estimated Completion Time
This unit can take a varying amount of time depending on the age of the students. It can be easily adapted for Scratch or Scratch Jr.

##Prerequisites
Students have already experimented with Scratch. They are ready to learn cartesian coordinates and loops.


##Teacher Notes & Pro Tips

* This project can also be done in Scratch Jr for younger students.
* In Scratch, the cartesian coordinates range from x(-240 to 240) & y(-180 to 180)
* It is recommended to create all the code for one star and then copying the sprite to other stars.

##Project Extensions
Students who complete this task early are encouraged to:

* Add music to their project. Record themselves singing and have the music begin when a star is clicked.
